The code line return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]); is used to convert an ArrayList of int arrays (List<int[]>) into a 2D array of ints (int[][]). Let me break down what this line does:
​
ans is an ArrayList that stores the merged intervals as int arrays. Each int array represents an interval with two elements: [start, end].
​
ans.size() returns the number of merged intervals in the ArrayList ans.
​
new int[ans.size()][] creates a new 2D int array with a number of rows equal to the size of the ArrayList ans. This is done to prepare the structure of the final result.
​
ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]) converts the ArrayList ans into a 2D int array. The toArray method is used to perform this conversion. The argument new int[ans.size()][] specifies the type of the resulting array, which is an array of arrays (2D array) of ints.
